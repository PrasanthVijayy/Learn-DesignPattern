ðŸ‘‰ BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN - CREATIONAL PATTERN ðŸ‘ˆ
------------------------------------

The Builder Pattern is used to create complex objects step-by-step. 

Itâ€™s especially helpful when the object youâ€™re creating has many parts or options, and you donâ€™t want to pass everything into the constructor at once. 

Instead, you build the object piece by piece, allowing flexibility and clarity.
