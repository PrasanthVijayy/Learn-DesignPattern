# Design Patterns Learning

## Overview

This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns used in software development. Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems, improving code organization and maintainability.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
2. **Factory Method**: Allows a class to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
5. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**: Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
2. **Decorator**: Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
3. **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
4. **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
5. **Bridge**: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Observer**: Allows one object to notify other objects about changes in its state.
2. **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
3. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients.
4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to override specific steps.
