ðŸ‘‰ SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN - CREATIONAL PATTERN ðŸ‘ˆ
------------------------------------

The Singleton pattern ensures that a "class has only one instance" and provides a "global point of access to that instance".

This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions or manage resources across an application. 

It promotes controlled access and consistency by allowing only a single instance of the class to exist.


ðŸ‘‰ KEY POINTS ðŸ‘ˆ
-----------------
Key Points of Singleton Pattern

Single Instance: Guarantees that only one instance of the class is created.

Global Access: Provides a global point of access to that instance.

Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it's needed, rather than at the start.
