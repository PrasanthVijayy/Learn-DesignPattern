👉 STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN
-----------------------------

The Structural design pattern is used to assemble the classes & objects to form larger structure it also keeps structure efficient and flexible.


1️⃣ Adapter Pattern:

    » Adapter design pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
    » It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces of a class into another interface that client expects.

Example:

    » If I want to use a system API which will responds with XML data, but our current system (interface) will require
    as JSON data structure to work with it, in that case Adapter pattern will work as bridge between 2 interface and make it work by converting it to JSON.


2️⃣ Decorator Pattern:

    » Decorator design pattern allows to add additional behaviour to objects and finally wrapping them as additional functionality.

Example:

    » Initially created a base class "Coffee" with cost function 10/-
    » After that created some classes with decorator pattern by adding additional toppings of cream 5/-
    » Then Sugar class as additional 2/-
    » Finally Ice class with additional 1/-
    » If we run it, the cost is getting added up setup by step!

3️⃣ Facade Pattern:

    » The Facade design pattern which provides a simplified interface to complex subsystem.

Example:

    » Here I created a homeTheatre setup with 5 subsystems.
    » Subsystems are: Lights, Projector, DVD player, Snacks, SoundSystem.
    » Here I just created simple functionality to all subsystems as separate files.
    » With Facade pattern (movieFacade.js) I made all interactions simple before bring to client code (main.js)
    » Finally getting the data the client, we are giving response in order without knowing client with Facade pattern.

4️⃣ Composite Pattern:

    » The Composite design pattern is simpler to "hierarchical inheritance" (in structure wise).
    » Components required: Component (base class), Leaf (least object, indivisible) & Composite (Aggregate objects that contain other objects and leaf's).

Example:

    » Here I created a file system as hierarchical way.
    » Where the Component (component.js), Composite (Folder.js) & Lead (File.js)
    » Finally we can just create files and folder and call the showDetails() in client code (app.js) 


5️⃣ Bridge Pattern:

    » The Bridge design pattern is used to separate abstraction from it's implementation so that they can be independent.

Example:

    » Here I created a file remoteControl.js for abstraction type. 
    » Also created a file device.js implementation type.
    » Finally we are bridge done with abstraction file.



6️⃣ Flyweight Pattern:

    » The Flyweight design pattern is used to minimize the worload to RAM.
    » It will separate as intrinsic (shared and unchange of data) and extrinstic state (Unique, differs between data by changing some attributes)

    Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State
    
    Intrinsic State:
        -> These are the properties that are shared and do not change between different objects of the same type. 
        -> In the Flyweight pattern, intrinsic states are stored inside the flyweight object itself. They represent essential, constant characteristics of the object.
    
    Extrinsic State:
        -> These are properties that can change and are provided externally when the object is used. 
        -> Extrinsic states are passed in as arguments to methods, so they don’t need to be stored inside the object.

Example:

    » Here I have created the intrinsic type (class.js) where it has color attribute remains unchanged once declared also position are extrinstic state will not stored in object.
    » With the client code, even if they try to create the different object, different postition and same color.
    » By just changing the new object's position, hence new object won't be created and just returning it.

7️⃣ Proxy Pattern:

    » This pattern will create as surrogate object from some other object, it can be access easily without puting to much load on actual object.
