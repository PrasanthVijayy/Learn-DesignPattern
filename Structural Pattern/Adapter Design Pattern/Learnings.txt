👉 STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN
-----------------------------

The Structural design pattern is used to assemble the classes & objects to form larger strucutre it also keeps structure efficient and flexible.


1️⃣ Adapter Pattern:

    » Adpater design pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
    » It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces of a class into another interface that client expects.

Example:

    » If I want to use a system API which will responds with XML data, but our current system (interface) will require
    as JSON data structure to work with it, in that case Adapter pattern will work as bridge between 2 interface and make it work by converting it to JSON.


2️⃣ Decorator Pattern:

    » Decorator design pattern allows to add additonal behaviour to objects and finally wrapping them as additional functionality.

Example:

    » Initially created a base class "Coffee" with cost function 10/-
    » After that created some classes with decorator pattern by adding additional toppings of cream 5/-
    » Then Sugar class as additional 2/-
    » Finally Ice class with additonal 1/-
    » If we run it, the cost is getting added up setup by step!
