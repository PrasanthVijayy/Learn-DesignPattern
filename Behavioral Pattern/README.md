# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, facilitating better interaction and coordination between them.

## a. Observer Pattern

- Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.
- Use Cases: Event handling systems, publish-subscribe systems.
- Advantages: Promotes loose coupling, dynamic relationships.
- Example: A news agency that notifies subscribers when a new article is published.

## b. Strategy Pattern

- Purpose: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.
- Use Cases: Selecting an algorithm at runtime, such as different payment methods or sorting algorithms.
- Advantages: Promotes the open/closed principle, allows for dynamic algorithm selection.
- Example: A navigation app that switches between different routing algorithms (shortest path, fastest path, etc.).

## c. Command Pattern

- Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.
- Use Cases: Implementing undo/redo functionality, executing menu actions in applications.
- Advantages: Decouples the request sender from the receiver, supports undoable operations.
- Example: A text editor that can execute, undo, and redo commands like cut, copy, and paste.

## d. State Pattern

- Purpose: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Use Cases: Managing different states of an object, such as traffic lights or a vending machine.
- Advantages: Simplifies state transition logic, reduces complexity by delegating behavior to state objects.
- Example: A phone application where the phone behaves differently based on its state (ringing, idle, in-call).

## e. Template Method Pattern

- Purpose: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm.
- Use Cases: Frameworks that provide a base class but allow customization.
- Advantages: Promotes code reuse, provides a clear structure for algorithms.
- Example: A cooking recipe template that defines steps for making meals (boil water, brew coffee/tea, etc.).

## f. Visitor Pattern

- Purpose: Lets you define new operations without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
- Use Cases: Operations on composite objects, such as object structure traversal.
- Advantages: Allows adding new operations without modifying object classes, simplifies adding new functionality.
- Example: A shopping cart that applies different operations, such as calculating discounts and taxes.

## g. Chain of Responsibility

- Purpose: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects a chance to process the request.
- Use Cases: Event handling systems, request processing pipelines.
- Advantages: Reduces coupling between the sender and receiver, allows for dynamic handling of requests.
- Example: A customer service system where requests are handled by different departments (support, billing, technical).
