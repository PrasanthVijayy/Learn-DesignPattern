👉 BEHAVIOUR DESIGN PATTERN
-----------------------------

These patterns focus on communication and the interaction between objects. They help objects cooperate by defining the flow of control and data in complex systems.

1️⃣ Chain of Responsibility:

    » Chain of Responsibility pattern will allow the request to handle through chains. 
    » Each chain (handlers) will decide to pass or reject the value to next chain.


Example:

    » Here we habe created 5 (1 main 4 inherit classes). Where the main class defines the how the value should be check and proceed for result (pass / reject).
    » Our example is about connecting to proper supportRequest team based on client request.
