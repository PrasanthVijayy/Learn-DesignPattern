# Design Patterns Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the study and application of design patterns in software development. It is structured into two main sections: **Learning 1.0** and **Learning 2.0**.

- **Learning 1.0**: Focuses on the fundamental concepts of various design patterns, providing foundational knowledge necessary for understanding and applying these patterns effectively.
- **Learning 2.0**: Contains practical problem statements that implement different design patterns. This section allows learners to apply the concepts learned in Learning 1.0 to real-world scenarios, enhancing their problem-solving skills.

## Structure

### Learning 1.0: Basic Fundamentals of Design Patterns

In this section, you will find resources and materials covering the essential principles of design patterns, including:

- **Introduction to Design Patterns**: Understanding what design patterns are and their importance in software development.
- **Categories of Design Patterns**: Overview of the three main categories:
  - **Creational Patterns**: Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms.
  - **Structural Patterns**: Patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects.
  - **Behavioral Patterns**: Patterns that define how objects interact and communicate with each other.
  - **Example of each Patterns**: Detailed descriptions and examples of each design patterns.

### Learning 2.0: Problem Statement & Solution Related to Design Patterns

This section contains various problem statements that allow you to implement the design patterns learned in Learning 1.0. Each problem statement includes:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the problem and its relevance.
- **Requirements**: Detailed specifications of what the solution should achieve.
- **Design Pattern Utilization**: Insights on how a particular design pattern is applied to solve the problem.
- **Solution Folder**: A designated folder containing the complete implementation for each problem statement, including code, examples, and necessary files.

## Common Elements

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Throughout the repository, naming conventions are maintained for easy navigation and understanding.
- **Code Quality**: Code samples are written following best practices, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Each problem statement and solution is thoroughly documented to provide context and explanations for the code implementations.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore Learning 1.0**: Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and principles of design patterns.
2. **Practice in Learning 2.0**: Apply your knowledge by tackling the problem statements in Learning 2.0, utilizing the appropriate design patterns.
3. **Expand Your Knowledge**: Feel free to add your own implementations, enhancements, or additional problem statements to further enrich the repository.
