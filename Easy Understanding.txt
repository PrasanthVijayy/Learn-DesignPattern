 1️⃣ Creational Patterns:
    These types of pattern basically focuses on creation of objects, ensuring the objects are created in controlled manner.

1. Singleton: 
    Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. Factory Method: 
    Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. Abstract Factory: 
    Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. Builder: 
    Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

5. Prototype: 
    Allows cloning of existing objects without modifying the original object, promoting object reuse.

2️⃣ Structural Patterns:
    Structural design pattern focuses on relationship between the classes and objects.

1. Adapter: 
    Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

2. Bridge: 
    Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently.

3. Composite: 
    Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

4. Decorator: 
    Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically without altering its structure, enhancing its behavior.

5. Facade: 
    Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system.

6. Flyweight: 
    Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of state among multiple objects, allowing for efficient management of large quantities of similar objects.

7. Proxy: 
    Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, enabling lazy loading, access control, or logging.

3️⃣ Behavioural Patterns:
    These patterns focus on communication and the interaction between objects. They help to define the flow of control and data in complex systems.

1. Chain of Responsibility:
    This type of pattern will let you pass request as a chain (handlers). Each handler will decide to pass or reject based on some conditions.

2. Command:
    This type of pattern will help to perform and display the result based on same commands as mediator.

3. Iterator:
    This pattern focuses on traverse collection without exposing their internal structures.

4. Mediator:
    This pattern is like a common person who takes are communication between other objects (a medium).
