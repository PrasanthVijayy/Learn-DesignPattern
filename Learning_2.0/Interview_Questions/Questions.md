8. Discuss the Memento Pattern and how it can be used to implement a rollback feature in a text editor application.
9. What is the Interpreter Pattern? In what scenarios would it be applicable?
10. Explain the Flyweight Pattern. How does it reduce memory usage for large numbers of similar objects?

## Structural Pattern Questions

1. What is the Adapter Pattern, and how does it help in making incompatible interfaces work together? Provide a coding example.
2. Explain the Decorator Pattern and give an example of how it can be used to extend the functionalities of an object without modifying its structure.
3. How does the Composite Pattern simplify the treatment of individual objects and compositions of objects? Provide a code example that demonstrates its use.
4. Describe the Facade Pattern. How does it provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem?
5. Explain the Bridge Pattern and how it helps in separating abstraction from implementation. Provide a coding example.
6. What is the Proxy Pattern? How can it control access to an object?
7. Discuss the Role of the Flyweight Pattern in optimizing memory. Provide an example scenario where it is beneficial.
8. What is the Structure of the Decorator Pattern? How does it differ from subclassing?
9. Explain the concept of the Composite Pattern. How does it manage complex tree structures effectively?
10. How can the Fa√ßade Pattern improve the usability of a complex system? Provide a practical example.

## Creational Pattern Questions

1. What is the difference between the Builder Pattern and the Factory Pattern? Provide a scenario where each would be appropriate.
2. Explain the Prototype Pattern. How can it be useful in situations where object creation is expensive? Give an example.
3. Can you discuss how the Object Pool Pattern helps manage resources effectively? Provide an example scenario.
4. What is the Singleton Pattern, and how does it ensure a class has only one instance? Provide a code example.
5. Describe the Abstract Factory Pattern and how it differs from the Factory Method. Provide examples for both.
6. How can the Builder Pattern be used to construct complex objects step by step? Provide a coding example.
7. Explain the use of the Factory Method Pattern in creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. Provide an example.
8. What is the difference between a prototype and a clone in the Prototype Pattern? Provide an example of each.
9. Discuss how the Factory Pattern can simplify object creation in a software application. Provide a use case example.
10. Describe how the Object Pool Pattern works. What are its benefits in resource management?

## Advanced Questions

2. What are the pros and cons of using the Visitor Pattern? In what situations would you prefer to use it over other patterns?
3. Explain how the Chain of Responsibility Pattern promotes flexibility and decouples the sender from the receiver.
4. Discuss the concept of Dependency Injection and its advantages in software design.
5. How does the Strategy Pattern facilitate runtime behavior change? Provide an example.
6. Explain the use of the Memento Pattern in state management. How can it be beneficial in a gaming application?
7. What is the role of the Observer Pattern in event-driven systems? How does it help in building responsive applications?
8. Describe the implementation of the Command Pattern in a graphical user interface application.
9. Explain how the State Pattern can help in reducing conditional statements in code. Provide an example.
