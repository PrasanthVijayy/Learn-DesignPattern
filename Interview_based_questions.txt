General Design Patterns

1. Define the Singleton Pattern and explain its use cases. Can you provide a code example?
2. How does the Factory Method differ from the Abstract Factory Pattern? Give examples of each.
3. Can you explain the concept of Dependency Injection and how it relates to design patterns?

Behavioral Patterns

4. In the Observer Pattern, what are the responsibilities of the Subject and Observer? How would you implement it in a real-world application?
5. Explain the Strategy Pattern with an example where different algorithms need to be applied at runtime. How would you structure the code?
6. Discuss the Command Pattern and how it can be used to implement an undo feature in an application. Provide an example.
7. How does the State Pattern manage the behavior of an object based on its internal state? Give a practical example of its use.
8. Describe the Template Method Pattern. How does it promote code reuse? Create an example of a meal preparation process using this pattern.

Structural Patterns

9. What is the Adapter Pattern, and how does it help in making incompatible interfaces work together? Provide a coding example.
10. Explain the Decorator Pattern and give an example of how it can be used to extend the functionalities of an object without modifying its structure.
11. How does the Composite Pattern simplify the treatment of individual objects and compositions of objects? Provide a code example that demonstrates its use.

Creational Patterns

12. What is the difference between the Builder Pattern and the Factory Pattern? Provide a scenario where each would be appropriate.
13. Explain the Prototype Pattern. How can it be useful in situations where object creation is expensive? Give an example.
14. Can you discuss how the Object Pool Pattern helps manage resources effectively? Provide an example scenario.

Advanced Questions

15. How can you implement the Mediator Pattern to manage complex communication between multiple objects? Provide a scenario where this pattern would be useful.
16. What are the pros and cons of using the Visitor Pattern? In what situations would you prefer to use it over other patterns?
17. Discuss the Memento Pattern and how it can be used to implement a rollback feature in a text editor application.
18. How can the Flyweight Pattern optimize memory usage in a system with a large number of similar objects? Give an example of its implementation.

Practical Tasks

19. Implement a simple chat application using the Mediator Pattern. Explain how the mediator facilitates communication between users.
20. Design a system using the Strategy Pattern to handle different payment methods in an e-commerce application. Describe how to switch between strategies at runtime.
21. Create a text editor application that utilizes the Command Pattern for operations like cut, copy, and paste, including undo/redo functionality.
